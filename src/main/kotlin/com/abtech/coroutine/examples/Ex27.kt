/**
withContext
You might notice that the way coroutineScope { /*...*/ } works very similar to async with immediate await: async { /*...*/ }.await().
Also withContext(context) { /*...*/ } is in a way similar to async(context) { /*...*/ }.await().
The biggest difference is that async requires a scope, where coroutineScope and withContext take the scope from suspension.
In both cases, itâ€™s better to use coroutineScope and withContext, and avoid async with immediate await.
